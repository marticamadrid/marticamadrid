              Cartagena was founded around the year 227 B.C. by the Carthaginian General Hasdrubal, on the
            site of an old settlement, and had its heyday in Roman times under the name Carthago Nova. The
            ci
            ty was part of the Byzantine Empire, was destroyed by the Visigoths and fell under Muslim
            control from 734 to 1245. From the 16th century the city played an important military role thanks
            to the strategic importance of its port, and in the 18th century it became the capital of the
            Mediterranean Maritime Department. <br>
            <br>
            In the second half of the 20th century Cartagena thrived once more thanks to the boom in the
            mining industry, which in turn boosted industry and trade there. The city suffered the dramatic
            consequences of the Civil War, during which it was one of the main strongholds of the republican
            government and, together with Alicante, the last city to fall into the hands of General Franco.
            Nowadays, now that the mineral resources have been exhausted, Cartagena lives mainly off
            shipbuilding and repair, petrol refinery and exporting olive oil, fruit, vegetables, esparto, wine and
            metal products. It is also one of the country‚Äôs main naval bases and an increasingly popular tourist
            attraction thanks to its important historic and cultural heritage.
